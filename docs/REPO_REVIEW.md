# Repository Review and Improvement Suggestions

This document summarises potential improvements to the CPST project.

## 1. File Organisation
- Use a `src/` layout (e.g. `src/cpst/`) to separate importable modules from top-level scripts.
- Add a dedicated `tests/` directory for unit tests.
- Move configuration files under `configs/` and keep generated artifacts in `results/` (ignored by Git).
- Remove compiled files (`__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`) and large binaries from version control.

## 2. Helper Utilities
- Create utility functions for loading configuration, seeding random generators, and common plotting routines.
- Expose a single entry point to run simulations programmatically (e.g. `cpst.run_simulation(config)`).

## 3. Redundant Code
- Many folders contain placeholder files (e.g. `complexity/`). Remove or complete them to avoid confusion.
- Compiled `.pyc` files and the sample GIF are unnecessary in the repository.

## 4. Alternative Framework
- Consider a class-based approach where a `Simulation` orchestrates background intensities and kernels.
- Configuration can be handled via `omegaconf` to construct components dynamically.
- Using a `src/` layout with standard packaging makes it easier to install and import the library.

These suggestions aim to make the repository easier to navigate and maintain.
